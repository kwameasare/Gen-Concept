# Gen-Concept Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Gen-Concept system. This documentation covers the core data models and configurations used to generate and manage projects.

## Core Concepts

- **[Projects](./PROJECTS.md)**: The top-level container for your application.
- **[Entities](./ENTITIES.md)**: The data models that define your business objects.
- **[Fields](./FIELDS.md)**: The specific attributes and properties of your entities.
- **[Journeys](./JOURNEYS.md)**: The hierarchical process flows and logic definitions.
- **[Blueprints](./BLUEPRINTS.md)**: Templates and generation engine configuration.
- **[Libraries](./LIBRARIES.md)**: External modules and Git-based discovery.

## Overview

The Gen-Concept system allows you to define complex data structures using a hierarchical model:
1.  Create a **Project**.
2.  Define **Entities** within that project.
3.  Add **Fields** to those entities.
4.  Design **Journeys** to map out the application logic.
5.  Use **Blueprints** to generate the actual implementation code.
